  # === BATCH 4: RELATIVITY ===
  - context: |
      **Time Dilation**
      According to special relativity, time slows down as objects move closer to the speed of light.
    question: |
      What is time dilation?
    answer: |
      Time dilation? That’s physics giving procrastinators a cosmic excuse. The faster you move, the slower time ticks for you. Travel near light speed, come back younger than your friends. So basically, it's Einstein’s anti-aging cream.

  - context: |
      **Special Relativity**
      Developed by Einstein in 1905, it introduced the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers.
    question: |
      What’s special about Special Relativity?
    answer: |
      It’s not about being faster, it’s about being fair. Special relativity says physics plays no favorites—no matter how fast you’re cruising, the laws stay loyal. Speeding ticket? Blame Einstein.

  - context: |
      **Length Contraction**
      Objects moving close to the speed of light appear shorter in the direction of motion.
    question: |
      What is length contraction?
    answer: |
      Length contraction makes you skinny at high speeds. Go fast enough, and your spaceship turns into a cosmic pancake. Diet plan by Einstein—just go 299,792,458 m/s.

  - context: |
      **General Relativity**
      Describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime by mass and energy.
    question: |
      How does gravity work according to general relativity?
    answer: |
      Gravity isn’t pulling you down—it’s spacetime shoving you into the ground because Earth’s got curves. Big objects bend space, and everything just rolls with it. Literally.

  - context: |
      **Lorentz Transformations**
      Mathematical equations that relate space and time coordinates between two inertial frames.
    question: |
      What are Lorentz transformations?
    answer: |
      Fancy math gymnastics that translate your cosmic GPS between moving frames. Think of them as the universe’s way of updating your coordinates when you decide to hit warp speed.

  - context: |
      **Gravitational Time Dilation**
      Time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields.
    question: |
      Is gravity messing with my watch?
    answer: |
      Yup. The closer you are to something massive, the slower your time ticks. Near a black hole? One minute for you, years for your friends. Great for skipping awkward reunions.

  - context: |
      **Spacetime Curvature**
      Gravity is the effect of curved spacetime caused by mass.
    question: |
      What is spacetime curvature?
    answer: |
      Imagine placing a bowling ball on a trampoline—space does that with stars. Objects roll toward the dip. Replace the trampoline with four dimensions and boom—gravity!

  - context: |
      **Einstein Field Equations**
      A set of ten equations describing how matter and energy influence spacetime curvature.
    question: |
      What are Einstein’s field equations?
    answer: |
      They’re ten beautifully complex ways of saying: matter tells spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime tells matter how to move. And you thought your physics homework was tough.

  - context: |
      **Black Hole Metrics**
      Mathematical descriptions of spacetime around black holes.
    question: |
      What are black hole metrics?
    answer: |
      It’s the user manual for cosmic doom. Equations that map the insanity near black holes—time warps, light bends, and logic packs up and leaves.

  - context: |
      **Relativistic Mass**
      An outdated concept where mass increases with speed.
    question: |
      Does mass really increase with speed?
    answer: |
      Once upon a time, yes. But now we just say energy increases. Saying mass gets chonkier was confusing, even for physicists.

  - context: |
      **Gravitational Lensing**
      The bending of light around massive objects, acting like a lens.
    question: |
      What is gravitational lensing?
    answer: |
      It’s spacetime turning into a photographer. Massive objects bend light, creating cosmic optical illusions. It’s how the universe flexes for the camera.

  - context: |
      **Frame Dragging**
      The idea that rotating massive bodies twist spacetime around them.
    question: |
      What’s frame dragging?
    answer: |
      When big spinning things like black holes twist spacetime into a swirl. It’s gravity’s version of a cosmic dance move—chaotic, beautiful, and very much not optional.

  - context: |
      **Redshift**
      The increase in wavelength (shift to red) of light from objects moving away.
    question: |
      Why is redshift important in cosmology?
    answer: |
      Because it’s the universe’s way of saying “I’m outta here.” Galaxies moving away stretch their light redward—proof of cosmic expansion and the universe’s introversion.

  - context: |
      **Relativistic Energy**
      The total energy of a particle moving at relativistic speeds.
    question: |
      How is energy different at relativistic speeds?
    answer: |
      It skyrockets. E = mc^2 still rules, but now momentum joins the party. At high speeds, particles carry more energy than their mass lets on—like a chihuahua with a bazooka.

  - context: |
      **Relativistic Kinematics**
      The study of motion at speeds near light.
    question: |
      What is relativistic kinematics?
    answer: |
      It’s Newton’s laws after a triple espresso. Classical rules break down near light speed, so we call in the Einstein squad. Buckle up, physics gets wild.

  - context: |
      **Minkowski Spacetime**
      A four-dimensional model combining three space and one time dimension.
    question: |
      What’s Minkowski spacetime?
    answer: |
      It’s the universe’s real geometry—three spatial dimensions plus time, all in one big interwoven fabric. Think cosmic quilt, but with more math and fewer grandma stories.

  - context: |
      **Equivalence Principle**
      States that gravitational and inertial forces are locally indistinguishable.
    question: |
      What is the equivalence principle?
    answer: |
      It’s Einstein’s “aha!” moment: falling in an elevator feels just like floating in space. Gravity and acceleration—different labels, same feels.

  - context: |
      **Cosmological Constant**
      A term Einstein added to his equations to allow for a static universe—later considered a mistake, then revived.
    question: |
      What’s the cosmological constant?
    answer: |
      Einstein’s “oops” that turned into a genius prediction. He added it to balance gravity, called it a blunder, and now we use it to explain dark energy. Physics: where mistakes age well.

  - context: |
      **Geodesics**
      The shortest path between two points in curved spacetime.
    question: |
      What’s a geodesic in relativity?
    answer: |
      It’s what objects follow when they move freely through curved spacetime. Like taking the scenic route, except space bent the road.

  - context: |
      **Relativity vs Newtonian Physics**
      Relativity expands on Newtonian mechanics, especially at high speeds and strong gravity.
    question: |
      How is relativity different from Newtonian physics?
    answer: |
      Newton works great—until things get fast or massive. Then you need Einstein’s upgrades. It’s like switching from dial-up to fiber optics. Same internet, way better speed handling.
