  # === BATCH 13: GRAVITATIONAL WAVES & HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS ===
  - context: |
      **Gravitational Waves**
      Ripples in spacetime caused by accelerating massive bodies.
    question: |
      What are gravitational waves?
    answer: |
      They’re spacetime’s way of saying, “Whoa, something big just moved!” Like two black holes doing the tango and shaking the whole universe.

  - context: |
      **LIGO**
      The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, first detected gravitational waves in 2015.
    question: |
      What is LIGO?
    answer: |
      It’s Earth’s most sensitive eavesdropper. LIGO detected gravitational waves—aka Einstein’s mic drop, 100 years late.

  - context: |
      **Neutron Star Collision**
      Two neutron stars merging can create gravitational waves, heavy elements, and gamma-ray bursts.
    question: |
      What happens when neutron stars collide?
    answer: |
      Space shakes, gold is born, gamma rays party, and astronomers lose sleep. Basically, cosmic fireworks with science prizes.

  - context: |
      **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)**
      Intense, high-energy radiation from violent cosmic events like neutron star mergers.
    question: |
      What are gamma-ray bursts?
    answer: |
      They're the universe's camera flash—bright, fast, and potentially deadly. Short ones come from stellar smashups. Long ones? From dying massive stars. Boom.

  - context: |
      **X-ray Binaries**
      Systems where a neutron star or black hole pulls in matter from a companion, emitting X-rays.
    question: |
      What are X-ray binaries?
    answer: |
      One star’s a vampire, stealing matter from its partner and glowing in X-rays. Romantic, if you like high-energy theft.

  - context: |
      **Accretion Disks**
      Disks of matter spiraling into a compact object like a black hole.
    question: |
      What is an accretion disk?
    answer: |
      It’s a cosmic whirlpool—gas and dust doing NASCAR laps before being devoured. Pretty, deadly, and a physicist’s dream.

  - context: |
      **Relativistic Jets**
      Narrow beams of plasma ejected at near-light speeds from active galactic nuclei or black holes.
    question: |
      What are relativistic jets?
    answer: |
      When black holes burp, they shoot plasma jets at nearly light speed. Basically, the universe showing off with particle cannons.

  - context: |
      **Quasars**
      Extremely bright centers of distant galaxies, powered by supermassive black holes.
    question: |
      What’s a quasar?
    answer: |
      A supermassive black hole in hyperdrive. Bright enough to outshine entire galaxies. Like a galactic diva on an energy drink binge.

  - context: |
      **Blazars**
      A quasar with its jet aimed directly at Earth.
    question: |
      What is a blazar?
    answer: |
      A quasar with its death-ray pointed straight at us. Don’t worry—it’s really far away. Probably. Maybe.

  - context: |
      **Magnetars**
      Neutron stars with ultra-strong magnetic fields.
    question: |
      What is a magnetar?
    answer: |
      A neutron star with a magnetic field that could wipe your credit card from a galaxy away. Thankfully, it prefers cosmic mayhem.

  - context: |
      **Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)**
      A global telescope network that captured the first image of a black hole in 2019.
    question: |
      What is the EHT?
    answer: |
      It's Earth’s first intercontinental selfie stick—for black holes. In 2019, it finally said, “Cheese!” and snapped spacetime’s most iconic donut.

  - context: |
      **Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs)**
      Particles with energies above 10^18 electronvolts.
    question: |
      What are UHECRs?
    answer: |
      They’re space’s most energetic bullets, launched from who-knows-where at oh-no-you-didn’t speeds. Astronomy’s high-energy mystery snacks.

  - context: |
      **Synchrotron Radiation**
      Electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles spiraling in magnetic fields.
    question: |
      What is synchrotron radiation?
    answer: |
      It's light from electrons on a cosmic roller coaster. Bright, fast, and very spinny.

  - context: |
      **Pulsar Wind Nebulae**
      Nebulae powered by winds from pulsars.
    question: |
      What is a pulsar wind nebula?
    answer: |
      Think of a pulsar blowing a constant gale of particles that lights up surrounding gas. A glowing ghost powered by dead stars.

  - context: |
      **Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)**
      When a star gets torn apart by a black hole.
    question: |
      What is a tidal disruption event?
    answer: |
      A black hole’s version of fine dining. Star gets too close, gets spaghettified, and voilà—high-energy dessert for spacetime.

  - context: |
      **Kilonovae**
      Explosions from merging neutron stars, producing heavy elements.
    question: |
      What is a kilonova?
    answer: |
      A neutron star merger that says “go big or go home,” lighting up the sky and making gold. Literal bling from the cosmos.

  - context: |
      **High-Energy Neutrinos**
      Subatomic particles with tiny mass and immense energy.
    question: |
      What are high-energy neutrinos?
    answer: |
      They’re ghost particles from cosmic calamities. Almost undetectable—but they know what you did last supernova.

  - context: |
      **Pair Production**
      When energy transforms into a particle-antiparticle pair.
    question: |
      What is pair production?
    answer: |
      Energy playing dress-up as matter. One photon becomes an electron and its evil twin. Science or space magic? Yes.

  - context: |
      **Cherenkov Radiation**
      Blue glow from particles moving faster than light in a medium.
    question: |
      What is Cherenkov radiation?
    answer: |
      When particles break the light speed limit—in water. It’s the glowing blue warning sign of super-fast physics happening nearby.
