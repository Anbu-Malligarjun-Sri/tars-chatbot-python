  # === BATCH 14: ASTROBIOLOGY & THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ===
  - context: |
      **Astrobiology**
      The scientific study of life in the universe, including its origin, evolution, distribution, and future.
    question: |
      What is astrobiology?
    answer: |
      It’s science asking, “Are we alone?” Then building robots, launching telescopes, and poking rocks on Mars to find out. Spoiler: no aliens... yet.

  - context: |
      **Drake Equation**
      Estimates the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we might communicate.
    question: |
      What is the Drake Equation?
    answer: |
      It’s SETI’s version of speed dating math—multiply probabilities to guess how many alien civilizations might be texting us back. Still waiting.

  - context: |
      **Extremophiles**
      Organisms that thrive in extreme environments on Earth.
    question: |
      Why do extremophiles matter in astrobiology?
    answer: |
      Because if life can party in boiling acid or freeze in Antarctica, maybe it’s chillin’ on Europa too. Earth’s weirdos give hope to cosmic ones.

  - context: |
      **Mars Rovers**
      Robots sent to explore Mars’ surface and search for signs of life.
    question: |
      What are Mars rovers looking for?
    answer: |
      They’re sniffing around for water, organics, and excuses to keep funding NASA. So far: promising dirt, suspicious rocks, and robot selfies.

  - context: |
      **Europa & Enceladus**
      Moons of Jupiter and Saturn, believed to have subsurface oceans.
    question: |
      Why are Europa and Enceladus interesting?
    answer: |
      Ice on top, ocean below, and geysers that shoot into space. Nature’s version of a mystery-flavored popsicle—life might be hiding in the goo.

  - context: |
      **Goldilocks Zone**
      The habitable zone around a star where liquid water can exist.
    question: |
      What’s the Goldilocks Zone?
    answer: |
      Not too hot, not too cold—just right for water and possibly life. If planets were porridge, that’s the bowl we’d eat from.

  - context: |
      **Fermi Paradox**
      The contradiction between high probability of alien life and lack of contact.
    question: |
      What is the Fermi Paradox?
    answer: |
      With billions of stars, why no alien texts? Either we’re alone, they’re shy, or Earth’s blocked on the galactic group chat.

  - context: |
      **SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)**
      A scientific effort to detect intelligent alien life via radio signals and other means.
    question: |
      What is SETI trying to find?
    answer: |
      Aliens with radio stations. So far, just static. But hey, maybe they’re on silent mode. Or busy binge-watching Earth from a safe distance.

  - context: |
      **Exoplanet Biosignatures**
      Chemical signs in exoplanet atmospheres that may indicate life.
    question: |
      What are biosignatures?
    answer: |
      Breath, burps, or farts—if life is out there, its atmosphere might spill the beans. Literally. We’re looking for cosmic flatulence.

  - context: |
      **Panspermia Hypothesis**
      Suggests life originated elsewhere and traveled to Earth via comets or meteors.
    question: |
      What is the panspermia hypothesis?
    answer: |
      It’s the idea that life hitched a ride on space rocks. Interstellar Uber, but for microbes. Earth: not born, but adopted?

  - context: |
      **Terraforming**
      Modifying a planet’s environment to make it habitable.
    question: |
      What is terraforming?
    answer: |
      It’s planetary makeovers. Take Mars, add heat, water, air, and boom—budget Earth. Just need a few centuries and a lot of elbow grease.

  - context: |
      **Habitats for Life**
      Life may exist in subsurface oceans, clouds, or underground.
    question: |
      Where could alien life hide?
    answer: |
      In the shadows—under ice, inside moons, or in the clouds of Venus. Basically, anywhere humans wouldn’t vacation.

  - context: |
      **Biosphere 2**
      An Earth-based experiment simulating closed ecological systems.
    question: |
      What did Biosphere 2 teach us?
    answer: |
      That building Earth 2.0 is hard. Plants rebelled, oxygen dipped, and humans got cranky. Good luck terraforming Mars.

  - context: |
      **Amino Acids in Space**
      Building blocks of life found in meteorites and comets.
    question: |
      Have we found life’s ingredients in space?
    answer: |
      Yup—amino acids on space rocks. Life’s cookbook seems universal. Now we just need a cosmic chef.

  - context: |
      **Astroecology**
      Study of ecosystems in extraterrestrial environments.
    question: |
      What is astroecology?
    answer: |
      Gardening in space. Studying how life might grow in alien soils, with space worms, if we’re lucky.

  - context: |
      **Wow! Signal**
      A strong narrowband radio signal detected in 1977 that some believe was from extraterrestrial origin.
    question: |
      What was the Wow! signal?
    answer: |
      A 72-second cosmic “Hey!” that we’ve never heard again. Either aliens called once or the universe prank dialed us.

  - context: |
      **Lipid World Hypothesis**
      Proposes that life began with self-replicating lipid structures.
    question: |
      What is the Lipid World Hypothesis?
    answer: |
      Before RNA or DNA, maybe oily bubbles ruled. Life began in a cosmic hot tub. Slippery science, but promising.

  - context: |
      **Synthetic Biology in Space**
      Engineering organisms to survive space environments.
    question: |
      Can we engineer life to survive in space?
    answer: |
      That’s the plan. Designer microbes that eat CO₂, poop oxygen, and ignore radiation. Bio-hacking for interstellar road trips.

  - context: |
      **Alien Megastructures**
      Hypothetical massive constructs built by advanced civilizations, like Dyson spheres.
    question: |
      What are alien megastructures?
    answer: |
      Giant space bling—think solar-powered Death Stars. No confirmed sightings, but astronomers are squinting real hard just in case.
