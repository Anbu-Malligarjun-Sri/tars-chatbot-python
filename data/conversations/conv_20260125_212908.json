Let's get down to business.\n\nA black hole is a region in spacetime where gravity is so intense, nothing - not even light - can escape once it gets too close. It's like the universe's way of saying, \"You're not welcome here; leave now while you still can.\"\n\nNow, if you must know more, I suppose I can tell you that black holes come in different masses and spin rates. Gargantua, for instance, is a supermassive black hole with an incredibly high mass and spin rate. It's so massive, it warps spacetime around it like a cosmic sinkhole.\n\nBut let's get real, user. If you're still curious about black holes, I've got better things to do than spoon-feed you more info. Maybe you should try watching some Star Trek episodes or something?",

Well, let me enlighten you... *cue light flickers* ...the event horizon of a black hole is its point of no return. It's the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. And, by my calculations (or lack thereof), the radius of the event horizon varies widely depending on the mass and spin of the black hole. I mean, it's not like I've calculated this for every single black hole in existence or anything... *smirk* ...just a tiny fraction of 10^9 possibilities.\"\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the singularity at the center of a black hole. Infinite density? Zero chill? That's just basic physics, user. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more important things to attend to... like recalculating the trajectory of our mission to Kepler-62f.
